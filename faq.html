		<h4 style="color: darkcyan">General questions</h4>
		<div class="FAQ_questions">
			<h5 style="color:darkgray"><b>Q: What is KaiseApp?</b></h5>
		</div>
		<div class="FAQ_answers">
			<h6>KaiseApp is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free. You can use KaiseApp on all your devices at the same time — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.</h6>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5><b>Q: Who is KaiseApp for?</b></h5>
		</div>
		<div><h6>KaiseApp is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and calls. Business users and small teams may like the large groups, usernames, desktop apps and powerful file sharing options.

				Since KaiseApp groups can have up to 100,000 members, we support replies, mentions and hashtags that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities efficient. You can appoint admins with advanced tools to help these communities prosper in peace. Public groups can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.

What‘s more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device. With KaiseApp’s cloud support and cache management options, KaiseApp can take up nearly zero space on your phone.
				
				Those looking for extra privacy should check out our advanced settings and rather revolutionary policy. And if you want secrecy, try our device-specific Secret Chats with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos — and lock your app with an additional passcode.</h6>

			<h5><b>Q: How is KaiseApp different from WhatsApp?</b></h5>
			<h6>Unlike WhatsApp, Unlike WhatsApp, KaiseApp is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync. As a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 1,5 GB each. And if you don't want to store all that data on your device, you can always keep it in the cloud.

					Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, KaiseApp is faster and way more secure. On top of that, KaiseApp is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.
					
					Our API is open, and we welcome developers to create their own KaiseApp apps. We also have a Bot API, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for KaiseApp, integrate any services, and even accept payments from users around the world. is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync.

		<div>
			<h5><b>Q: Which devices can I use?</b></h5>
			<h6>You can use KaiseApp on smartphones, tablets, and even computers. We have apps for iOS (6 and above), Android (4.1 and up) and Windows Phone. You can also use KaiseApp's web version or install one of our desktop apps for Windows, OSX, and Linux.</h6>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5><b>Q: Where is KAiseApp based?</b></h5>
			<h6>The KaiseApp development team is based in Singapore.

					Most of the developers behind KaiseApp originally come from India, the city famous for its unprecedented number of highly skilled engineers. The KaiseApp team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried a number of locations as its base, including Berlin  and London. We’re currently happy with Dubai, although are ready to relocate again if local regulations change.</h6>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5><b>Q: Will you have ads? Or sell my data? Or steal my beloved and enslave my children?</b></h5>
			<h6>No</h6>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5><b>Q: How are you going to make money out of this?</b></h5>
			<h6>We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.

					Pavel Durov, who shares our vision, supplied KaiseApp with a generous donation, so we have quite enough money for the time being. If KaiseApp runs out, we will introduce non-essential paid options to support the infrastructure and finance developer salaries. But making profits will never be an end-goal for KaiseApp.</h6>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5><b>Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?</b></h5>
			<h6>Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years. Their marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools that allow hiding your public posts or your profile pictures from the people around you. Adding these superficial tools enables companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data to marketers and other third parties.

					At KaiseApp we think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be instead:
					
					Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.
					Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.
					This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities. KaiseApp's aim is to create a truly free messenger, without the usual caveats. This means that instead of diverting public attention with low-impact settings, we can afford to focus on the real privacy issues that exist in the modern world.</h6>
		</div>
		<h4 style="color: darkcyan">KaiseApp Basics</h4>
		<div>
			<h5><b>Q: Who can I write to?</b></h5>
			<h6>You can write to people who are in your phone contacts and have KaiseApp. Another way of contacting people is to type their KaiseApp username into the search field.

					You can set a public username for your KaiseApp account too. Other people will be able to search and find you by that username — and send messages to you even if they don't know your number. You can learn more about usernames here.</h6>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5><b>Q: How do I know who in my contacts has KaiseApp?</b></h5>
			<h6>Your contacts, who have KaiseApp, are shown at the top of your Contacts. They also have pictures.</h6>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5><b>Q: Can I hide my ‘last seen’ time?</b></h5>
			<h6>You can choose who sees this info in Privacy and Security settings.<br>

					Remember that you won‘t see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don’t share your own. You will, however, see an approximate last seen value. This keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over KaiseApp.<br>
					 There are four possible approximate values:<br>
					
					Last seen recently — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days<br>
					Last seen within a week — between 2-3 and seven days<br>
					Last seen within a month — between 6-7 days and a month<br>
					Last seen a long time ago — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)</h6>
